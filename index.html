            <p>X-VISION2023 Capacity Building Workshop aims to provide a unique platform for students and young 
              researchers from developing nations to learn how to analyze X-ray data from missions like 
              <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton">XMM-Newton</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nicer">
              NICER</a> and <a href="https://www.nustar.caltech.edu/">NuSTAR</a>. 
              The teams of experts include a number of renowned senior lecturers
              from various fields. The hands-on sessions will be led by the respective instrument team
              members. One of the objectives of this Workshop is to inspire and prepare young researchers
              to use future X-ray observing facilities like <a href="https://xrism.isas.jaxa.jp/en/">XRISM</a>,
              <a href="https://www.the-athena-x-ray-observatory.eu/">ATHENA</a>, 
              <a href="http://www.arcusxray.org/">Arcus</a> etc. 
              These observatories will undoubtedly usher in a new era in X-ray astronomy and advance our
              understanding of the energetic universe.<br><br>This is the first time the International 
              Astronomical Union (<a href="https://www.iau.org">IAU</a>)
              and Committee on Space Research (<a href="https://cosparhq.cnes.fr/">COSPAR</a>) are joining hands
              for supporting a Capacity Building Workshop in Astronomy. This workshop is also generously 
              supported in various forms 
              by the South African Gamma-ray Astronomy Programme (<a href="https://sagamma.org/">SA-GAMMA</a>),
              and Centre for Space Research at North-West University (<a href="https://www.nwu.ac.za/">NWU</a>),
              National Aeronautics and Space Administration (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>),
              and European Space Agency (<a href="https://www.esa.int/">ESA</a>) in various forms.
              
              <br><br><strong><a style="color:#008ef7;">There is no registration fee for this workshop.
              </a></strong>
              Limited financial support for travel is also available. Accommodation of all the selected 
              participants shall be provided by the organizers.
                         
              The participants with accompanying person(s) should send us an email on 
              <a href="mailto: xrayvision2023@gmail.com">xrayvision2023@gmail.com</a>
              to get accomodation arranged by the organizers. Unfortunately, the expenses for any accompanying
              person will not be covered by the workshop.
                                
              <br><br> The <a href="https://www.iau.org/training/iau-hands-on-workshops/">IAU I-HOW</a> and
              <a href="https://cosparhq.cnes.fr/events/cospar-capacity-building-workshops/">COSPAR Capacity 
              Building Workshops</a> have a rich history of enriching young researchers across the globe with
              technical and scientific knowledge in diverse areas of Space Science and Astronomy.
              
              These short training cum teaching programmes are very effective and provide 
              ample opportunities for collaborative research with experts. This particular 
              Workshop also aims to highlight a number of research programmes, in line with main research 
              themes, in South Africa and to explore new possibilities of Pan-Africa collaborations.
              
              <br><br>
              These Capacity Building Workshops also promote cultural exchange between participants through 
              various activities outside normal workshop hours.

            points do not guarantee selection, which is competitive and shall be conducted by an independent committee.
              However, writing around following points  will definitely add clarity in your letter.</p>

                It will be nice to add sentences to emphasize the anticipated role(s) of the data from
                missions of interest i.e., one or more of XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and NICER. </div>

                in these fields are not mandatory to attend this workshop, but, it is always effective to reflect
